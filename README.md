Cat game

Word guessing game. A variation on the famous Hangman game, but made to run on a console, with a life system and more.

In this game, the player, like a cat, "possesses" seven lives (Brazilian culture), and for every mistake in trying to guess the word, one of the lives is removed. 
Play and be happy in this variant of Hangman!

To test it out, download the files and run the script.js file using NodeJS.
